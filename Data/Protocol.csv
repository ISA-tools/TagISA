"Extraction","The second aliquot was used for LC-MS analysis. 30 μL of serum sample was mixed with 120 μL of cold ACN/H2O (1:1) with 1% meta-phosphoric acid (MPA) and 0.1% formic acid (previously filtered). Samples were vortexed vigorously for 30 seconds and stored at 20C for 2 hours to enable protein precipitation. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged 15 minutes at 4C and 15000 rpm and the supernetant was transferred to a LC-MS vial. ","MTBLS103"
"Chromatography","Samples were injected in a UHPLC system (1290 Agilent) coupled to a quadrupole time of flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer (6550 Agilent Technologies) operated in positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) mode. Metabolites were separated using either C18-RP (ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 1.8 ?L, Waters) or HILIC (ACQUITY UPLC BEH 1.7 ?L, Waters) chromatography at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The solvent system in C18-RP was A= 0.1% formic in water, and B= 0.1% formic in acetonitrile. The linear gradient elution started at 100% A (time 0�3 min) and finished at 100% B (20�21 min). The solvent system in HILIC was A= 50mM NH4OcA in water, and B= ACN. The linear gradient elution started at 95% B (time 0�2 min) and finished at 55% B (6 min). ","MTBLS103"
"Mass spectrometry","The injection volume was 2 μL. ESI conditions were gas temperature, 225C; drying gas, 13 L min-1; nebulizer, 20 psig; fragmentor, 125 V; and skimmer, 65 V. The instrument was set to acquire over the m/z range 80-1200 with an acquisition rate of 4 spectra/s. ","MTBLS103"

"Sample collection","Adult patients were recruited from the outpatient clinics and inpatient wards of the Tanta University Hospital in Tanta, Egypt. The participants consist of a total of 89 subjects (40 HCC cases and 49 patients with liver cirrhosis). The protocol of the study was approved by the ethical committee at Tanta University. Detailed characteristics of the patient populations are provided in Table 1. Through peripheral venepuncture, single blood sample was drawn into 10 mL BD Vacutainer sterile vacuum tubes without the presence of anticoagulant. The blood was immediately centrifuged at 1000g for 10 min at room temperature. The serum supernatant was carefully collected and centrifuged at 2500g for 10 min at room temperature. After aliquoting, serum was kept frozen at -80 °C until use. Primary tubes and serum aliquots were labeled using anonymous confidential code numbers with no personal identifiers. Identification codes were cross-referenced with clinical information in a pass code protected computer system. ","MTBLS105"
"Extraction","Plasma metabolites were extracted by adding 1 mL of working solution composed of acetonitrile, isopropanol, and water (3:3:2) containing isotope-labeled internal standards at a concentration of 1.25 μg/mL (tyrosine-3,3-d2, glutamic acid-2,3,3,4,4-d5, alanine-2,3,3,3-d4, phenylalanine-phenyl-d5-2,3,3,-d3, glycine-d5, myristic acid d27) to 30 μL of plasma. After vortexing, samples were centrifuged at 14,500 rpm for 15 min at room temperature. The supernatant was then divided into two, 460 μL each, for analysis by the two GC-MS systems. The supernatants were then concentrated to dryness in speedvac. The dried samples were kept at -20 °C until derivatization prior to analysis by GC-MS.,"MTBLS105"

"Sample collection","Six different spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines were used in the experiments. Treated ears were sampled either directly after treatment (time point 0) or 12, 24, 48 and 96 hours after treatment. The ear was cut from the plant and the non-treated spikelets were removed by clipping the rachis with a surgical scissor below and above the treated spikelets. The treated ear part including the rachis and complete spikelets (chaff and florets) was put in a small vial. Harvested samples were immediately quenched in liquid nitrogen and subsequently stored at -80°C until further processing. Each of the frozen wheat samples were milled to a fine powder for 2 min at 30 Hz using a ball mill (MM301 Retsch, Germany) with liquid nitrogen pre-cooled 10 mL stainless steel vessels and a 9-mm stainless steel ball.","MTBLS112"
"Extraction","The homogenized wheat ears (100±2 mg fresh weight) were weighed into Eppendorf tubes and extracted with 1 mL of pre-cooled methanol/water 3+1 (v/v) including 0.1% formic acid, by vortexing for 10 seconds and further treatment in an ultrasonic bath at room temperature for 15 min. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 8,500 × g at 4°C and 200 µL of the supernatant were combined with 140 µL water, 75 µL chloroform and 10 µL of internal standard mixture. After shaking, the tubes were again centrifuged for 4 min at 8,500 × g at 4°C and 200 µL of the methanol/water phase were transferred into micro-inserts in GC/HPLC vials. The samples were evaporated overnight using a centrifugal evaporator (Labconco, Kansas City, MO) at 15°C and subsequently put on the GC auto sampler (PAL LHX-xt, CTC Analytics, Carrboro, NC) for an optimized online two step derivatization procedure. The sample was re-suspended in 40 µL MOX (20 mg/mL pyridine) and agitated for 90 min at 60°C. Thereafter, 50 µL MSTFA and 10 µL internal standard (NONA, 370 mg/L) were added before the vial was again agitated at 60°C for 60 min. Prior to analysis, the samples were kept in the drawer for 10 min at 4°C to allow equilibration and sedimentation of particles. ","MTBLS112"
"Chromatography","For separation and detection of analytes an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph coupled to a 5975C inert XL MSD detector (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) was used. The instruments were controlled by ChemStation software (Agilent Technologies, version E.02.01.1177). A volume of 1 µL of the liquid sample was injected into the split/splitless injector at 250°C in split mode and using a split of 25:1. An HP5-ms column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 µm; Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) was operated at a constant flow of 1 mL/min helium. After keeping the oven at 50°C for 2 min, it was heated to 310°C (10°C/min) and subsequently kept at this temperature for 15 min.","MTBLS112"
"Mass spectrometry","Compounds were detected from m/z 50-800 utilizing the 5975C inert XL MSD detector (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). The MSD interface was kept at 290°C throughout the run. After 7 minutes of solvent delay, the detector was used in scan mode The EI source was kept at 230°C and the MSD quadrupole at 150°C. Autotuning of the MSD was performed at least once a week or after exchange of spare parts.","MTBLS112"
"Data transformation","Raw GC-MS data files were acquired by ChemStation and exported in the net.cdf format. The converted files were subsequently imported by the MetaboliteDetector software (version 2.5.20130104-Linux) and further processed. Besides mass spectral deconvolution (settings: peak threshold 5; minimum peak height 5; deconvolution width 7; required number of peaks 20) and computation of feature areas for relative quantification, the retention index for compound recognition was calculated and the corresponding spectra were compared to an in-house library.","MTBLS112"
"Metabolite identification","Retention indices and GC-MS spectra were compared to an in-house library. This library was established by measuring 132 authentic reference standards using the same derivatization protocol, analytical parameters and instrument as the wheat samples analysed in this study. Metabolites were identified by comparison of mass spectra and retention indices to the spectra library using a cut-off value of 70%. The feature areas of three specific fragment ions were recorded for each metabolite and the ion with the highest signal to noise ratio was detected by an in-house, Python based software, and chosen for further data processing and comparative quantification in all samples.","MTBLS112"
"Sample collection","In this study, Euglena gracilis wild-type Z strain and a streptomycin-bleached mutant SM-ZK with less chloroplasts (Mccalla, 1963; Oda et al., 1982) were used. They were maintained in 150 mL of Koren-Hutner medium (pH 5.0) in Sakaguchi flasks at 27°C under continuous light on a shaker (120 rpm) for 2 days (early-log phase) or 4 days (late-log phase) (Koren and Hunter, 1967). Wax ester fermentation was induced either by halting the culture agitation, which stops aeration and induces hypoxia, or by aerating N2 gas into culture medium for 10 min to remove oxygen and other gases, including carbon dioxide, completely. For anoxic conditions induced by N2 gas aeration, different NaHCO3 concentration (1 mM and 10 mM) were added to investigate the effect of a carbon source on wax fermentation. Cells were collected 0, 4, and 24 h after the initiation of anaerobiosis and were immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen followed by lyophilization.","MTBLS113"
"Extraction","The method for the extraction of lipophilic compounds was modified from Furuhashi and Weckwerth (2013). Approximately 5 mg of lyophilized Euglena sample was homogenized with quartz sands (Wako, Osaka, Japan) (approximately 300 mg) in 1 mL of MCA solvent (methanol/chloroform/2 % acetic acid, 5:2:1, v/v/v) using a Mixer Mill MM400 (Retsch, Haan, Germany) for 90 s at 30 Hz. For absolute quantification, 60 µg C20:0 FAME (Larodan, Sweden) was added into 1 mL MCA solvent before homogenizing. The sample was centrifuged at 21,000 × ɡ for 3 min. The supernatant was divided into two fractions, retaining 200 µL for wax ester analysis and the remaining 800 µL for total lipophilic compound analysis. Phase separation was conducted by adding 500 µL of water and 400 µL of chloroform to the supernatant. The sample was centrifuged at 21,000 × ɡ for 3 min, and an upper polar phase was removed. The remaining inter-phase and the bottom apolar phase were desiccated using a centrifugal evaporator (Thermo Fischer, Waltham, MA, USA). ","MTBLS113"
"Chromatography","GC-MS measurements were carried out on a gas chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometer (GC-TOF-MS) (Auto sampler, JASCO PAL GC-xt; GC, Agilent 6890N; MS, Waters GTC premier) instrument (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA; Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The injector temperature was 230°C using a cold trap splitless mode. The flow rate of carrier He gas was 1 ml/min-1. GC separation was performed on an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). After a 1-min isothermal period at 70°C, the temperature was programmed to 76°C at a heating rate of 1°C min-1, then to 350°C at a heating rate of 6°C min-1 and maintained for 1 min. The temperatures of the GC-MS transfer line and the source of the mass spectrometer were 340°C and 250°C, respectively. ","MTBLS113"
"Mass spectrometry","GC-MS measurements were carried out on a gas chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometer (GC-TOF-MS) (Auto sampler, JASCO PAL GC-xt; GC, Agilent 6890N; MS, Waters GTC premier) instrument (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA; Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The mass spectrometer was operated in an electron-impact mode (EI) at 70 eV in a scan range of m/z 40-600. ","MTBLS113"

"Metabolite identification","Metabolites were identified based on their mass spectral characteristics and retention times by comparison with retention times of reference compounds in an in-house reference library. All metabolites were quantified using QuanLynx (Waters, Milford, MA, USA), a software for the analysis of mass spectrometric data.","MTBLS113"
"Derivatization","For wax esters and other free form lipophilic compound profiling, the dried apolar (with inter-phase) pellet was incubated with 20 µL methoxamine-HCl (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) solution (40 mg/mL pyridine) for 90 min at 30°C. N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifuoroacetamide (80 µL; MSTFA: Sigma-Aldrich) for silylation was added and incubated for 30 min at 37°C, and 1 µL of the sample was injected into the GC-MS. 2.4 Methyl esterification and derivatization for total lipophilic compound profiling,"MTBLS113"

"Data transformation","Acquired data (*.raw format) were processed using the software SIEVE v1.3 (Thermo Scientific) installed in a 12-core 64-bit PC workstation (Windows 7 Ultimate SP1, Intel Core™ i7 CPU, 24 GB RAM). Although the software is designed for the analysis of LC/MS data, with appropriate changes in the settings, we were able to analyse data obtained by DIMS. The acquired mass spectra between 0.6 and 1.2 min were processed. Obtained frames [rectangular regions of m/z vs retention time (RT)] were filtered based on their coefficient of variation distribution (CV) in the reconstructed ion chromatograms (RIC).

"Extraction","Samples were collected from the field according to the leaf plastochron index (LPI), tagged and frozen in dry ice.  For current year shoot segments, we defined LPI 1 as the first leaf below the shoot tip that was at least 1 cm in length (internode 1 would be directly above this), and counted down to collect internode 12.  For the previous year growth, internode 1 was assigned as below the terminal bud scar, counting down the stem to internode 7.   Since trees showed different amounts of growth (number of internodes) in a given year, a continuous internode counting down from the shoot tip to the previous year's growth was not applicable.  Samples in the laboratory were stored at -80 °C prior to processing, which was initiated by freeze-drying to a constant weight.  Twigs were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently ground in a P14 mill (Pulveristette 14; Fritsch) with a 0.5 mm sieve at maximum speed (20,000 rpm) to generate a fine powder.  The samples were collected in labeled, pre-weighed 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and dried, after which the mass was recorded.  Sample extraction was performed on 10 mg fractions using (50:50 LCMS grade MeOH:H2O, 1 ml).  The tube contents were mixed by vortexing, placed in a shaker (Boekel Sci; Feasterville, PA) and incubated 200 minutes at 30 °C.  The tubes were then removed, vortexed briefly and allowed to sit overnight at room temperature.  The samples were then vortexed and centrifuged (13,000 x g, 5 min, RT) with the extracts (450 µl) transferred to prelabeled, ethanol-washed tubes.  The samples were then concentrated via centrifugal concentration until approximately 200 µl remained and were then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and dried overnight on high vacuum line with liquid nitrogen trap.   The resulting dried extract was then weighed to determined yield.","MTBLS119"

L. corniculatus var. San Gabriel and L. tenius (Lotus glaber) var. La Esmeralda were obtained from the LOTASSA consortium (http://www.lotassa.com). Seeds were germinated in plates containing half-strength BD agar [1] plus 2 mm KNO3 and 2 mm NH4NO3. For the evaluation of survival to long-term lethal NaCl levels, seedlings (at least 40 of each species) were transplanted to pots containing a mixture of sand and perlite (1:1) irrigated with nutrient solution, and grown in the greenhouse under a 16/8 h day/night, 23 ± 2 °C and 55–65% relative humidity regime. Eight days post-imbibition, the salt concentration in the nutrient solution was increased in 25 mm NaCl steps every three days to reach 300 mm NaCl. This concentration was used to continue irrigation, until all the plants died. The number of dead plants as a function of time was recorded. Plants were scored dead when the whole plant or all the leaves were wilted or chlorotic. For the gradual salt stress acclimation experiments, seedlings were transplanted to soil (type Null Einheitserde, Wandorf, Germany) and irrigated with nutrient solution. The stress treatment was started 8 days post-imbibition. The salt concentration in the nutrient solution was increased in three steps of 4 day intervals from 50, 100 to 150 mm NaCl [2]. In two successive independent experiments, L. creticus was tested parallel to the other Lotus species. Each independent experiment included sample sets of control and salt-treated plants. Each sample set had at least five independent biological replicates and each replicate was a pool of at least five plants. The total duration of the cultivation was 32 d. Complete shoots, pools of leaves, petioles and stems omitting cotyledons were harvested in situ in the middle of the light period and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The experimental design induced neither senescence nor was lethal within the cultivation period. At harvest, all plants were still in the vegetative stage and non-nodulated. Biomass was estimated by the mean fresh weight of the pooled shoot samples.,"MTBLS14"

L. corniculatus var. San Gabriel and L. tenius (Lotus glaber) var. La Esmeralda were obtained from the LOTASSA consortium (http://www.lotassa.com). Seeds were germinated in plates containing half-strength BD agar [1] plus 2 mm KNO3 and 2 mm NH4NO3. For the evaluation of survival to long-term lethal NaCl levels, seedlings (at least 40 of each species) were transplanted to pots containing a mixture of sand and perlite (1:1) irrigated with nutrient solution, and grown in the greenhouse under a 16/8 h day/night, 23 ± 2 °C and 55–65% relative humidity regime. Eight days post-imbibition, the salt concentration in the nutrient solution was increased in 25 mm NaCl steps every three days to reach 300 mm NaCl. This concentration was used to continue irrigation, until all the plants died. The number of dead plants as a function of time was recorded. Plants were scored dead when the whole plant or all the leaves were wilted or chlorotic. For the gradual salt stress acclimation experiments, seedlings were transplanted to soil (type Null Einheitserde, Wandorf, Germany) and irrigated with nutrient solution. The stress treatment was started 8 days post-imbibition. The salt concentration in the nutrient solution was increased in three steps of 4 day intervals from 50, 100 to 150 mm NaCl [2]. In two successive independent experiments, L. creticus was tested parallel to the other Lotus species. Each independent experiment included sample sets of control and salt-treated plants. Each sample set had at least five independent biological replicates and each replicate was a pool of at least five plants. The total duration of the cultivation was 32 d. Complete shoots, pools of leaves, petioles and stems omitting cotyledons were harvested in situ in the middle of the light period and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The experimental design induced neither senescence nor was lethal within the cultivation period. At harvest, all plants were still in the vegetative stage and non-nodulated.

"Sample collection","For these experiments, there was one chemotherapeutic (docetaxel) and three environmental perturbations (glucose deprived, hypoxia, and ischemia). For the chemotherapeutic perturbation, samples were taken at 0 minutes, 24 hours, and 48 hours. For the hypoxic and glucose deprived perturbation, samples were taken at 0 minutes, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours. For OCCs, medium was removed and cells were quickly washed with 1 ml PBS at 37 °C, which was aspirated off, and then 700 µl of 80:20 methanol/water solution at -80 °C was added immediately. The plate was then incubated at -80 °C for 15 minutes. After incubation, remaining cellular debris were harvested using a cell scraper (BD Falcon, San Jose, CA) for intracellular analysis. For OCSCs, the media-cell mixture was transferred to a filter cup (Microcheck II beverage monitor, Pall, Port Washington, NY) with a pre-wetted membrane (0.45 µm pore Express PLUS Polyethersulfone membrane, Millipore, Billerica, MA) and the medium was filtered from the cells. The cells were then quickly washed with 4 ml PBS at 37 °C. The filter was then removed and placed upside down in a petri dish containing 1.5 ml of 80:20 methanol/water solution at -80 °C. The samples were then incubated at -80 °C for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, the petri dish was removed and the filter was flipped over and washed using the 1.5 ml 80:20 methanol/water solution to remove any debris still caught in the filter. An extraction blank was made for the OCSCs following the same procedure above but only 4 ml PBS was washed through the filter. For both cell types, the intracellular solution was then transferred to a microcentrifuge tube in a cold ethanol bath and centrifuged at 5,000 g for 5 minutes at -4 °C. The supernatant was retained, and the pellet was subsequently re-extracted twice in 100 µl of the cold 80:20 methanol/water solution, with all supernatants being pooled. Intracellular and extracellular samples were stored at -80 °C and -20 °C, respectively, until analysis.","MTBLS150"
"Extraction","Before derivatization, intracellular samples were vacuum concentrated in a CentriVap at 40 °C until completely dry. Samples were aliquoted so as to be already normalized to cell count: cell density at sample time had been measured on a hemacytometer, and the volume that was vacuum concentrated was varied for each sample in order to yield a final concentration of 3,000 live cell equivalents/µL after derivatization. The samples were derivatized following the protocol laid out by Fiehn, et. al. Briefly, 2.5 µl of 40 mg/ml O-methylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (MP Biomedicals, LLC, Santa Ana, CA) in pyridine was added to the dried sample and shaken at 1400 rpm for 90 minutes at 30 °C. 22.5 µl of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) + 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) (Thermo Scientific, Lafayette, CO) was then added to the samples which were then shaken at 1400 rpm for 30 minutes at 37 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 21,100 g for 3 minutes and 10 µl of the supernatant was added to an autosampler vial. Samples were spiked with 0.10 µl of a retention time standard solution consisting of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and an internal standard of nonadecanoic acid methyl ester dissolved in dimethylformamide.","MTBLS150"
"Chromatography","A LECO Pegasus 4D instrument with an Aglient 7683B autosampler, Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph and time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS) was used to analyze the samples. The instrument was controlled using ChromaTOF. A sample volume of 1 µl was injected into the split/splitless inlet at 250 °C in splitless mode. The first column was an HP-5, 30 m long x 0.320 mm ID x 0.25 µm film thickness (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), and the second was an Rtx-200, 2 m long x 0.25 mm ID x 0.25 µm film thickness (Restek, Bellefonte, PA) with a constant flow rate of 1.00 mL/min helium. The initial oven temperature was set to 70°C and was held for one minute after which the temperature was increased at 10 °C/min until reaching 315 °C with a final hold for two minutes.","MTBLS150"
"Mass spectrometry","A LECO Pegasus IV D time of flight mass spectrum (TOF-MS) was used. The total MS method time was based on the GC method time with an acquisition delay of 240 seconds. The collection mass range was from 50 to 500 u. The acquisition rate was set to 200 spectra/second. The detector voltage was set to 100 V above the optimized voltage with the electron energy set to -70 V. The mass defect mode was set to manual with the mass defect 0 mu/100 u. The transfer line temperature was set to 320 °C and the ion source temperature was set to 220 °C.","MTBLS150"
"Data transformation","Sample files were first analyzed in ChromaTOF (LECO, St. Joseph, MI) to determine baseline, peak area, and peak identification. Briefly, settings included a baseline offset of 0.5, automatic smoothing, 1st dimension peak width of 24 seconds, 2nd dimension peak width of 0.10 seconds, and a match of 700 required to combine peaks with a minimum signal-to-noise (S/N) of 5 for all subpeaks. Peaks were required to have a S/N of 10 and have a minimum similarity score of 800 before assigning a name. Unique mass was used for area and height calculation. Analytes were then aligned across the sample files using MetPP (http://metaopen.sourceforge.net/metpp.html). After alignment, further processing of the data was done based on the procedure laid out by Dunn, et. al. Batch effects were removed from the intracellular data set using LOESS. To remove analytes that were not reproducibly detected, analytes for which more than half of the values were missing in the QC samples or for which the QC samples had a coefficient of variance larger than 0.5 were removed from the data set. Then, missing values were manually corrected using small value correction only if all the values were missing in the biological replicate. Analysis of final data set was performed using MetaboAnalyst (http://metaboanalyst.ca/).","MTBLS150"
"Metabolite identification","GC-MS spectra were compared to several libraries including the Golm Metabolome Library, NIST spectral libraries, and an in house library. Analytes were identified by mass spectra comparison to the libraries with a cut-off of 700/1000. Metabolites were identified from the annotated analytes by comparison to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) or the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB); if they were listed in KEGG or HMDB they were identified as metabolites.","MTBLS150"
"Extraction","Before derivatization, both intracellular and extracellular samples were dried down in a CentriVap at 40 °C until completely dry. For the intracellular samples, the volume removed was calculated based on a total of 3 x 105 cells at the end of derivatization. For the extracellular samples, the entire supernatant from the extracellular extraction was dried down. The samples were derivatized following the protocol laid out by Fiehn, et. al. Briefly, 10 µl (extracellular) or 2.5 µl (intracellular) of 40 mg/mL O-methylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (MP Biomedicals, LLC, Santa Ana, CA) in pyridine was added to the dried sample and shaken at 1400 rpm for 90 minutes at 30°C. 90 µl (extracellular) or 22.5 µl (intracellular) of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) + 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) (Thermo Scientific, Lafayette, CO) was then added to the samples which were then shaken at 1400 rpm for 30 minutes at 37 °C.

"Sample collection","The participants in this study comprised adult patients, who were prospectively recruited from the hepatology clinics at Georgetown University Hospital (GUH), Washington, DC. All patients provided informed consent and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Georgetown University. All patients were diagnosed to have liver cirrhosis on the basis of established clinical, laboratory and/or imaging criteria. Cases were diagnosed to have HCC based on well-established diagnostic imaging criteria and/or histology. Controls were required to be HCC free for at least 6 months from the time of study entry. Human blood was drawn from adult patients and collected by venepuncture into 10 ml BD Vacutainer sterile vacuum tubes without the presence of anticoagulant. The blood was immediately centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min at room temperature. The serum supernatant was carefully collected and centrifuged at 2500 x g for 10 min at room temperature. After aliquoting, serum was kept frozen at -80 °C until use. Primary tubes and serum aliquots were labeled using anonymous confidential code numbers with no personal identifiers. Identification codes were cross-referenced with clinical information in a pass code protected computer system.","MTBLS17"

Mixture was then spun at 10,000  x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant organic solution was transferred, speed-vacuum dried at room temperature and reconstituted in 50 µl of mobile phase (2% ACN containing 0.1 % formic acid) ready for injection.","MTBLS17"
"Chromatography","From each sample, 5 μl was injected onto a reverse-phase 50 × 2.1 mm ACQUITY 1.7-μm C18 column (Waters Corp, Milford, MA) using an ACQUITY UPLC system (Waters) with a gradient mobile phase consisting of 2% ACN in water containing 0.1% formic acid (A) and 2% water in ACN containing 0.1% formic acid (B). Each sample was resolved for 10 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The gradient consisted of 100% A for 0.5 min then a ramp of curve 6 to 60% B from 0.5 min to 4.0 min, then a ramp of curve 6 to 100% B from 4.0-8.0 min, a hold at 100% B until 9.0 min, then a ramp of curve 6 to 100% A from 9.0 min to 9.2 min, followed by a hold at 100% A until 10 min.","MTBLS17"
"Mass spectrometry","The column eluent was introduced directly into the mass spectrometer by electrospray.Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on a Q-TOF Premier (Waters) operating in both positive and negative mode. The capillary voltage was set to 3.2 kV and 3 kV, and the cone voltage of 30 V and 20 V, respectively. The desolvation gas flow was set to 800 l/h and the temperature was set to 350 °C. The cone gas flow was 25 l/h, and the source temperature was 120 °C. Accurate mass was maintained by introduction of LockSpray interface of sulfadimethoxine (311.0814 [M+H]+ or 309.0658 [M-H]-) at a concentration of 250 pg/μl in 50% aqueous ACN and a rate of 150 μl/min. UPLC-QTOF data were acquired in centroid mode from 50 to 850 mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) in MS scanning using the MassLynx software (Waters).","MTBLS17"
"Data transformation","The raw data were converted into Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) format using the MassLynx software (Waters). We used the XCMS package to preprocess each of the three UPLC-QTOF MS datasets separately. The first step in XCMS is to detect the peaks. The peak detection algorithm first cuts the UPLC-QTOF data into slices, a fraction of a mass unit wide, and then applies a model peak matched filter on those individual slices over the chromatographic time domain. After detecting peaks in individual samples, the peaks are matched across samples to allow calculation of retention time (RT) deviations and relative ion intensity comparison. This is accomplished using a grouping method that uses kernel density estimation to group peaks in the mass domain. The peak matching algorithm in XCMS takes into account the two-dimensional anisotropic nature of data. These groups are then used to identify and correct drifts in RT from run to run. Following data preprocessing, ion annotation is conducted to identify derivative ions such as isotopes, adducts, and in-source fragments. This helps group ions that originated from the same metabolite on the basis of their monoisotopic masses and elution profiles. We used the R-package CAMERA for ion annotation.","MTBLS17"
"Metabolite identification","For difference detection, in-house developed MATLAB (Natick, MA) and R scripts were used on the basis of parametric and non-parametric statistical tests (t-test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test). In both statistical tests, we calculated the false discovery rate (FDR) to correct for multiple testing. To select ions with significant and consistent changes between HCC and cirrhotic patients in multiple experiments, we used an ion-annotation-assisted approach. This approach is designed to determine overlapping ions among multiple experiments by taking into consideration the presence of a large number of derivative ions such as isotopes, adducts, and fragments. This is accomplished by grouping ions into clusters, where each ion in a cluster is represented by its monoisotopic mass. This mass is then used to compare the ions across the three experiments. The common ions obtained based on monoisotopic masses using the ion annotation information are merged with those selected on the basis of their ion masses only. Putative identifications for the resulting ion list were obtained through mass-based search against four databases: the Human Metabolite DataBase (HMDB), Metlin, Madison Metabolomics Consortium Database (MMCD), and LIPID MAPS. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA) and MetaboAnalyst (http://www.metaboanalyst.ca/) were used to perform enrichment analysis on a list of putative identifications of altered metabolites to identify a biological pathway that can be further investigated. Identities of some of the putative metabolite identifications were verified by comparing their MS/MS fragmentation patterns and RT with those of authentic standard compounds. Absolute quantitation of metabolite candidates was performed using isotope dilution technique by UPLC-SRM-MS analysis on the QTRAP 4000 and XEVO TQ instruments.","MTBLS17"

Chloroform extracts were prepared as previously described, using the dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) method (Tugizimana et al. 2012). Briefly, 24 h post treatment, the excess media was filtered using a Buchner funnel and the cells were collected. Two grams of cells were re-suspended in 20 mL of methanol and homogenised using an Ultra Turrax homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 5525 × g for 7 min at 25 °C. The supernatants were placed into 50 mL round-bottom flasks, and the methanol evaporated to 1 mL at 50 °C using a Buchi Rotavapor R-200. To this, 1 mL of the crude aqueous extract, 200 µL of chloroform and 100 µL of methanol were added.  The mixture was vortexed for 30 s and centrifuged at 15 000 × g for 6 min at 25 °C in a glass centrifuge tube. Using a syringe, the bottom chloroform extraction layer was removed and filtered through 0.22 µm nylon filters, and placed into pre-labelled GC glass vials containing glass inserts and fitted with slitted caps. A general methanol extraction was carried out as previously described, with modification where necessary (Madala et al. 2014; Tugizimana et al. 2014).

Putative identifications of the monoisotopic masses were found using MetaboSearch to search against four databases: the Human Metabolite DataBase (HMDB), Metlin, Madison Metabolomics Consortium Database (MMCD), and LIPID MAPS. The mass tolerance in MetaboSearch was set to 10 ppm. Identities of some of the putative metabolite identifications were verified by comparing their MS/MS fragmentation patterns and RT with those of authentic standard compounds. Quantitation of metabolite candidates was performed using isotope dilution technique by UPLC-SRM-MS/MS analysis on the QTRAP 4000 (AB Sciex) instrument. Because of the high physiochemical similarities between the labeled internal standard and the analyte, degradation during sample preparation, variations in instrumental response, and ion suppression effects in LC−ESI−MS can be compensated. Quantitation of metabolites was achieved by correlating their ratio of MS signals detected by SRM in the calibration curves that we constructed by relating the varying amounts of each analyte to their relative response factors (RRFs) as determined by the ratio of the peak area of the analyte to that of the corresponding isotope-labeled internal standard.","MTBLS19"
"Extraction","50 µL of each lithium heparin treated plasma sample was diluted with 150 µL of MeOH [spiked with 4% 13C6-Sorbitol as an extraction internal standard (ISTD)]. The samples were briefly vortexed and placed on ice for 10 mins prior to being centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 5 mins at 4 °C to precipitate any protein present. 100 µL supernatant was separated and transferred into 6 mm diameter conical bottom glass vial inserts that had been placed inside eppendorf vials. An additional 10 µL supernatant from each extracted sample was combined into a separate eppendorf vial, which was vortexed and used to create 5 x 100 µL pooled biological quality control (PBQC) glass vial inserts. Eppendorf vials containing inserts were then dried in vacuo at a temperature of -55 °C and pressure of 3 mbar for 2 hrs. Glass vial inserts were then placed into 2 ml wide top glass vials and covered with metallic crimp caps (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA). Additional glass vials containing MeOX (methyloxime) (10 µL per sample) and TMS (trimethysilyl) (20 µL per sample) were prepared for derivatisation.","MTBLS191"

"Extraction","The frozen urine samples were thawed in an ice-bath and then centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 15 min. 12.5 µL supernatant was taken into an Eppendorf tube and totally dried using a Speed Vac. The sample was re-dissolved to 50 µL with water or a specific matrix solution. Then 25 µL of 250 mM sodium carbonate/sodium bicarbonate buffer and 25 µL of ACN were added into the sample. The solution was vortexed, spun down, and mixed with 50 µL of freshly prepared 12C-dansyl chloride solution (18 mg/mL) (for light labeling) or 13C-dansyl chloride solution (18 mg/mL) (for heavy labeling). After 45 min incubation at 40 0C, 10 µL of 250 mM NaOH was added to the reaction mixture to quench the excess dansyl chloride. The solution was then incubated at 40 0C for another 10 min. Finally, formic acid in 50/50 ACN/H2O was added to consume excess NaOH and to make the solution acidic. The 12C- or 13C-labeled sample was centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 10 min before injecting onto the ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) column for UV quantification (see below). For LC-MS analysis, the 12C- and 13C-labeled samples were mixed in equal amounts based on the quantification results.","MTBLS194"

"Metabolite identification","Differential features detected in narrow retention time windows displaying a high chromatogram correlation were grouped. In combination with the raw data, individual compound mass spectra were reconstructed and features annotated as cluster ion, quasimolecular ion, or in-source fragment ion. Annotated lists of all differential feature sets are provided in Supplemental DataSet S5 of DOI: 10.1007/s11306-012-0401-0 online. Afterwards, targeted CID-MS/MS experiments of quasimolecular ions (MS2) were performed using QTOF-MS. Based on accurate mass measurements, putative elemental compositions were calculated, filtered by isotope abundance and the number of double bond equivalents and electron parity [1], and checked for consistency in relation to elemental compositions calculated for fragment ions and observed neutral losses [2]. Mass spectral characterization of CID mass spectra can be found in Supplemental Data Set S6 (DOI: 10.1007/s11306-012-0401-0) online.

"Sample collection","All culture work was conducted within a Microflow biological safety cabinet and all work areas thoroughly cleaned with 70% ethanol before use. The cell culture medium utilised in this work was Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and to avoid any bias in this undefined reagent we used a single batch. All DMEM used in this work also originated from a single batch. 1% Penicillin (5000 units/mL) and Streptomycin (50 mg/mL) were used to inhibit bacterial and fungal growth. To ensure sufficient biomass for GC-MS analysis HaCaT cell growth was conducted in 225 cm2 culture flasks utilising standard cell culture procedures. Dithranol was applied when cells were determined by microscopy to be ~90% confluent and then incubated further for 24 h. Dithranol was dissolved in 100% acetone and applied to the cells to give a final concentration range of 0.1-0.5 μg/mL (0.4-2.2 μM) in 0.1 μg/mL steps. In addition to these 5 concentrations a control was used which  involved the application of acetone only at the relevant volume. All drug solutions were made afresh before application to the cells. As shown in Figure 1 all drug exposures plus control were performed in triplicate.  Microscopic inspection was undertaken and no obvious differences in cell confluency or cell structure were observed between the control and drug treated flasks after 24 h and the concentration range of dithranol was comparable with doses that induce minimal apoptosis in highly confluent HaCaT cells.","MTBLS202"
"Extraction","Sample preparation was performed on both the cells as well as the spent culture media (footprint or exometabolome) were analysed. The method for cellular analysis was essentially the same as Teng et al. [Teng Q, Huang WL, Collette TW, Ekman DR, Tan C (2009) A direct cell quenching method for cell-culture based metabolomics. Metabolomics 5 (2):199-208. doi:10.1007/s11306-008-0137-z], but rather than washing with ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) we used room temperature PBS (15 mL) in order to reduce temperature shock to the cells. This brief washing took ca. 5 s, after which the cells were quenched and extracted using 100% methanol (7 mL, -48 °C) and detached from the surface by scraping the cells with a disposable cell scraper (Corning, UK). The methanol/cell mixture was thentransferred to a centrifuge tube for extraction. Extraction was aided by three freeze-thaw cycles to liberate as many metabolites as possible. After centrifugation (14°C, 5 min, 16200 g) to pellet the cell debris the supernatant was stored at -80°C. The spent culture media were aspirated from each culture flask and filtered through a 0.45 μm pore size cellulose acetate membrane syringe filter to remove any remaining cellular debris. The filtered metabolic footprint samples were aliquoted (1 mL) into centrifuge tubes and immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. All samples were stored at -80°C.,"MTBLS202"

Centrifuge tubes containing the solution during harvest were cooled in a pre-chilled cooling box to keep sample temperature below -20 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 16,100 rcf for 2 min with the centrifuge and rotor cooled at -20 °C. Supernatant was decanted and residual liquid carefully removed. The pellet was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized at -50 °C in a 2 mL round bottom Eppendorf tube. Lyophilized cells were disrupted using the ball mill MM 301 (Retsch GmbH & Co., Germany) in two variants for 3 minutes: (a) using 0.5 ml of glass beads (500 μm i.d., Sigma, St.Louis MO) concomitant with 0.5 ml extraction solvent and (b) using a single 5 mm i.d. steel ball, followed by the addition of 0.5 mL extraction solvent and vortexing. After 2 min centrifugation at 16,100 rcf, the supernatants were removed (200 μl for the glass bead method, 350 μl for the steel ball method) followed by a secondary extraction step using an additional 800 μl extraction solvent, centrifugation and adding the supernatant (700 μl for the glass bead method) to the first aliquot. Hence, for both methods the same fraction of extraction solvent was used (70% of total extraction volume). Five different extraction solvent system (methanol:isopropanol:water (5:2:2)) was used. Extracts were concentrated to dryness in a vacuum concentrator. Dried extracts were kept at -80 °C for up to 4 weeks before derivatization and analysis by GC-TOF mass spectrometry.","MTBLS208"

There was an acquisition delay of 120 s.","MTBLS212"
"Data transformation","ChromaTOF software version 4.32 was used to perform baseline correction, deconvolution and peak picking of the raw data. The baseline offset was set to 1, just above the noise level. The first dimension peak width was set to 43 s while the second dimension peak width was set to 0.1 s. A factor of 500 was set as the match required to combine peaks in the second dimension. A signal to noise (S/N) of 10 was used for the 10 s and 5 min extraction times data with a minimum S/N of 6 for sub peak retention. A S/N of 100 was used for the 30 min extraction time data with a minimum S/N of 60 for sub peak retention. Traditional integration was used. Forward library searching was used with the following parameters: Hits to return were set to 10, minimum molecular weight was set to 40, maximum molecular weight was set to 350, the mass threshold was set to 50 and the minimum similarity match was set to 700. The NIST and Wiley libraries were used. For alignment the following parameters were used: a mass threshold of 10, a minimum similarity match of 600, the maximum number of modulation periods matching peaks could be apart was set to 1, a maximum retention time difference was set to 7 s, for peaks not found by initial peak finding the signal to noise ratio was set to 5 for the 10 s and 5 min extractions and to 50 for the 30 min extractions, for analytes to be kept they had to be found in all biological replicates within a class.

"Chromatography","GC/MS measurements were carried out on a time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer (AccuTOF GCv 4G; JEOL, Akishima, Japan) equipped with a 7890A GC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Typical column, injector settings, and temperature programs were as follows. The injection volume was 1 µl (splitless) in EI mode. In FI mode, 2 µl was injected using splitless mode unless otherwise stated. The injector temperature was set at 230 °C. GC separation was performed on a HP-5MS capillary column (30 m x 0.32 mm x 0.25 µm; Agilent Technologies) with a carrier gas (He) flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The oven temperature gradient for the derivatized standard saccharides was as follows. After a 4 min, 70 °C isotherm period, the oven was programmed to rise to 325 °C at a rate of 35 °C/min, then held at 325 °C for 1 min. The temperature of the GC/MS transfer line was set at 250 °C.","MTBLS215"
"Mass spectrometry","An EI/FI combination ion source was used with the JEOL AccuTOF GCv 4G GC/oaTOFMS system, which has been partially updated from the prototype described previously in [1] The ion source temperature was set at a value in the range of 130–250 °C for EI, and 70–220 °C for FI. Unless otherwise stated, EI voltage and current were 70 V with 300 µA and 18 V with 100 µA, respectively. For FI measurements, carbon emitters purchased from CARBOTEC (Bonn, Germany) were used; the emitter (CARBOTEC FI) consists of a 5 µm tungsten wire with a carbon microneedle coating, max current on which is 11.5 mA. Cathode voltage for FI was set at –l0 kV. The emitter was refreshed with a 10 mA flush current for 30 ms in every 400 ms spectral data acquisition cycle as described previously [1]. Each emitter could be used for 80 repeated injections, at least, without any visible sign of degradation in spectral patterns or increased background signals. The recording m/z range was 10–1600 in all ionization modes. Typical pressures in the ion source and mass analyzer were on the order of 10–4 Pa and 10–5 Pa, respectively, for both EI and FI modes. The micro-channel plate detector voltage was set at 1700 V for regular EI mode, 2100 V for low-voltage (18 V) EI mode, and 2100 V for FI mode. The detector gain differences (peak intensity enhancement) between each voltage setting were 12.7 times (from 1700 V to 1850 V) and 125 times (from 1700 V to 2100 V), respectively.","MTBLS215"

Mice were maintained on a regular light (14 h)/dark(10 h) cycle and fed a standard laboratory chow diet (FED group) or high-fat diet (HFD group) containing 4.5 or 34 wt% fat in the diet, respectively. The third group of mice was fed a chow diet, but were fasted 14 h prior to euthanasia (FAS group). Starting with 6-week-old animals, the intervention trial was carried out two times under identical conditions. In each of the three groups, three animals were kept for 6 weeks in one cage per group with ad libitum access to food and water. During the intervention period, mice weights were monitored regularly. At the end of the 6 weeks feeding period, animals were euthanized at 8 AM under anesthesia with Narkodorm (60 µl/100 g weight) and the abdomen was surgically opened. Primary hepatocytes from livers were isolated as described previouly [1] with modifications. Prior to liver perfusion, buffers and collagenase type II solution (20 mg collagenase type II in 100 ml Krebs-Henseleit buffer without SO4(2-) but containing 0.1 mM CaCl2, 2% BSA) were brought to 37 °C. Each liver was perfused via the hepatic portal vein with Krebs-Henseleit buffer without Ca2+ and SO4(2-) (115 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 5.9 mM KCl, 1.18 mM MgCl2, 1.23 mM NaH2PO4, 6 mM glucose) for 10 min, followed by perfusion with collagenase type II solution.

"Data transformation","In the NCI-MD cohort, chromatograms were first visually inspected using Waters MassLynx to ensure their quality and 12 samples were removed due to poor quality (e.g. undetectable spiked in control, break in signal). All subsequent data analyses were performed using R, a freely available language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. The R package XCMS2, version 1.22.1, was utilized to extract and align peaks for all detected metabolites. Peak areas for all signals were extracted using the following criteria: ppm=25, mzdiff=-0.005, snthresh = 10, scanrange=c(1,500), peakwidth=c(5,12), prefilter=c(1,30)). Retention times were aligned using one iteration of the rector() function using the loess method, which performs smoothing of the retention time deviations for every time point in each sample. Peaks were then found using the group() function with the following parameters: bw=10, minfrac=0.1, mzwid=0.01. Next, ESI+ and ESI- signals were merged on lung cancer cases and healthy control samples that were in common between both sets (N = 1257) and signals with masses that had a ppm error larger than 50 were removed from further analysis. This filtering reduced the total number of signals from 2756 and 1804 to 1807 and 1359, for ESI+ and ESI- modes, respectively. Next, a normalization algorithm analogous to MSTUS (MS 'total useful signal')3 normalization was applied. Signals that are putative xenobiotics (e.g., acetaminophen) were removed before calculating the scaling factor using the following criteria: signals with very high abundance (> 90th percentile) in at most 100 samples and with very low abundance (,"MTBLS28"
"Metabolite identification",= 20th percentile) in at least 800 samples. Scaling factors, total intensity counts for each sample divided by the mean total intensity counts of all samples, were then used to normalize signal abundances. Finally, signals with variation (measured by coefficients of variation) between duplicates higher than variations between randomly selected sample pairs were removed.","MTBLS28"
"Sample collection","Cell culture Cells of the YSBN.6 strain were grown in minimal medium with 10g/L glucose (either 12C- or 13C-labelled glucose). The minimal medium was prepared according to Verduyn et al. with 10mM phthalate buffer to maintain a pH value of 5.0 [Yeast 8:501-517] Cells were always grown at 30°C while shaking with 300 rpm. Pre-cultures were inoculated from YPD plates and grown in 5ml medium for approximately 9 hours to a maximum OD600 of 1.5. The pre-culture was used to inoculate the main culture with a start OD600 of 0.005 in 25 mL of Verduyn minimal medium. Cells of the main culture were harvested between an OD600 of 1.0 and 1.2.","MTBLS29"

"Mass spectrometry","MS measurement The MALDI MS measurements were carried out on a commercial MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (ABI4800 Plus, AB Sciex, Concord/ON, Canada). This instrument is equipped with a 355-nm solid-state laser. Measurements were conducted in the negative-ion reflectron mode, analyzing a mass range between 70 and 1100 m/z, and using 100 shots (10 subspectra x 10 shots) with center biased rastering. In our measurements, we heavily rely on the accuracy of the mass measurements for confidence on the metabolite identity. In order to exclude any possible mass shifts that may be caused by slightly tilted surfaces or in homogeneity of the conductivity of the MAMS coating and therefore irregular electric fields, we introduced evenly spaced calibration spots surrounding the 100 um array. Prior each MS measurement, the MS instrument was calibrated using 13 metabolite standards evenly distributed in the mass range of interest. MS/MS analyses were conducted using the collision-induced dissociation (CID) cell in the ABI4800 instrument and air as the collision gas. Unfortunately, tandem mass spectrometry on the same cell sample is not possible in our case, due to limited amount of material present within one microwell. Therefore, we normally carried out tandem MS measurements on different wells to the one in which the parent ions were originally measured. Some times, it was necessary to combine the MS/MS measurements of a whole MAMS chip to obtain a suitable tandem MS spectrum. Therefore, it was critically also for our purposes to align the MAMS plate (i.e. the microwells) with the laser ionization spots using optical marks. By using the alignment marks, it was possible to run automated measurements, using the ABI mass spectrometer software, in a reproducible manner.","MTBLS29"
"Data transformation","Data treatment and data analysis software Spectral data (i.e. accurate mass, signal intensity, peak resolution) were calculated from the raw spectra using the ABI4800 software package (4000 Series Explorer V3.5.3, and Data Explorer Software Version 4.9). Chemical assignments (identities) of 26 metabolites were made on the basis of accurate mass measurements (accuracy of 20 ppm or better), the isotope ratios of the corresponding signals, and metabolic databases (ChemBioFinder [http://chembiofinder.cambridgesoft.com/]; Chemspider [http://www.chemspider.com/]; Kegg [http://www.genome.jp/kegg/]; Metlin [http://metlin.scripps.edu/]; and Yeastnet [http://www.comp-sys-bio.org/yeastnet/]). The chemical assignments were verified by comparing the respective tandem MS/MS spectra to the ones obtained from commercially available standards, and by using 13C-labeled cells, which were obtained by growing the yeast cells in 13C-labeled glucose. In order to exclude data with faulty assignments, the masses of at least 24 metabolites must be present in the spectrum with a mass deviation lower than 20 ppm (ideally lower than 15 ppm). Phosphoglyceric acid and Acetyl-Coenzyme A were not considered for further data analysis due to their constant mass deviation of 20 ppm or higher. Any spectra that did not contain all 24 metabolites signals within this mass error were discarded. If the ABI4800 software package was unable to recognize a precise peak (even if the S/N ratio was higher than 3), the peak resolution was calculated manually, and the mass intensity as well as its mass-to-charge ratio were calculated from ASCII files using a MATLAB peak recognition software (version 7.6.0.324 (R2010a), MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). The ASCII files were generated using macros written within the ABI Data Explorer Software. All data from the ABI software packages were then exported to Microsoft Excel(TM). In Excel, the signal intensities for each metabolite in one MAMS microwell, were divided by a known 9-amino acridine unsaturated background signal ([C4H2O4 - H]-, m/z 112.98933) and the number of cells counted within that well, providing us with the relative signal intensity for each metabolite at the single-cell level. This simple procedure allowed us to compensate for any inconsistencies in the matrix deposition, shot-to-shot and spot-to-spot variation, as well as in differences in the number of trapped cells (biomass) between MAMS microwells. However, to avoid other unexpected sources of variation (e.g. signal suppression, inefficient metabolite extraction, etc) between MAMS substrates, we used the signal of one of the measured metabolite as internal standard. In our case, we selected glutamate (C5H9NO4 - H]-, m/z 146.04588) as an internal standard, since its relative signal intensity for a whole MAMS plate remains constant, within the time frame of our study and for the different measured sample treatment if the cells originated from the same colony innoculation. Therefore, all metabolite signals obtained from one MAMS chip were adjusted by one single factor, if the average glutamate signal in the whole MAMS plate had a deviation of 10% or more from the expected value. Such complex data processing is necessary to reduce the technical variability between measurements, which if not removed or minimize could later been misinterpretate as cell-to-cell variability.","MTBLS29"

"Cell counting","Cell counting Prior to spotting the cells on the MAMS target for the MALDI MS measurement, the cells were reconstituted in 500 µL of a MeOH/ddH2O mixture (60:40) + 0.85% (w/V) ammonium bicarbon ate buffer, pre-cooled at -40°C, and carefully shaken to avoid cell aggregation. The samples were transferred to pre-cooled Eppendorf vials (2 mL). The Eppendorf vials were centrifuged at -10◦C for 1 min at 1000 g (fixed rotor). The supernatant was removed to avoid any remaining growth medium to be trapped in the cell pellet. The cell pellet was reconstituted in ≈50 µL of 60% MeOH in ddH2O (-40°C) and slightly shaken. Then, 2 µL of the cell suspension (≈2,500,000 cells per mL) was spread over a cooled MAMS plate (-4°C). The distribution of the number of cells per well is stochastic (i.e. Poisson distribution). After the cells were distributed on the MAMS chip, the rest of the reconstituted yeast sample was once more centrifuged and shock frozen for population-level (bulk sample) control measurements at a later time point. To avoid any changes to the metabolism during the cell counting step, the MAMS plate was cooled using liquid nitrogen in a nitrogen-rich atmosphere (with a constant flow of N2 gas) to avoid condensation of moisture from air on the surfaces of the MAMS chip and the microscope optics. To avoid any cross-contamination between empty- and cell-containing-wells in the MAMS, the chip was placed in a dry-freezing cham ber for 15 min, after counting the cells. This step allowed us to remove residual moisture that remains on the surface of the MAMS chip prior the matrix deposi tion step. Most of the metabolites that were detected in this publication, using the MAMS platform, are the most abundant metabolites found within S. cerevisiae cells.","MTBLS29"
"Cell handling","Cell handling The cell handling protocol was adapted from Ewald et al.[Anal Chem 81:3623-3629]. In brief the workflow consisted on the following: 1 mL from the main culture of yeast cells (YSBN.6) was quenched in 4 mL of a MeOH/ddH2O mixture (60:40) + 0.85% (w/V) ammonium bicarbonate buffer, and pre-cooled at -40°C. Three types of aliquots were prepared from the main culture of yeast cells: Reference samples were untreated aliquots; Control samples were aliquots treated with 500 µL of HPLC-MS grade water (ddH2O) at 4°C; and Treated samples were aliquots treated with 500 µL of a 2% (mg/mL) solution of 2-deoxy-d-glucose (HPLC-MS grade water). The falcon tubes containing the different aliquots were immediately submerged in a -40°C glycerol bath for 1 minute to ensure quenching of the metabolism. The samples were then centrifuged for 1 minute at -10°C at 1000 g in a non-fixed rotor centrifuge. The supernatant (growth medium) was removed, and the falcon tube containing the cell pellet was then shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until the measurement.","MTBLS29"
"MS/MS","MS/MS analyses were conducted using the collision-induced dissociation (CID) cell in the ABI4800 instrument (1 KV) and air as the collision gas on MAMS and stainless steel MALDI plates. Unfortunately, for MAMS, tandem mass spectrometry on the same cell sample is not possible in our case, due to limited amount of material present within one microwell. Therefore, we normally carried out tandem MS measurements on different wells to the one in which the parent ions were originally measured. Sometimes, it was necessary to combine the MS/MS measurements of a whole MAMS chip to obtain a suitable tandem MS spectrum or use bigger microwell reservoirs. Therefore, it was critically also for our purposes to align the MAMS plate (i.e., the microwells) with the laser ionization spots using optical marks. By using the alignment marks, it was possible to run automated measurements, using the ABI mass spectrometer software, in a reproducible manner.","MTBLS29"

"Sample collection","S. Typhimurium wild type cells (ATCC 14028) were used throughout this study and were taken from a single colony on an agar plate, subsequently inoculated into 7 mL of Luria-Bertani (LB) media (comprised of 1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% sodium chloride at pH 7), and incubated overnight at 37°C. The overnight culture was centrifuged and the supernatant discarded. The cell pellets were suspended in LB media and centrifuged again, and the supernatant was discarded. For LB cultures, the cell pellets were subsequently suspended in 2 mL of LB media and used to inoculate 700 mL of LB in a 2.8 L flask. After 160 min of growth, cells were harvested via centrifugation (4,000×g) and washed twice with Dulbecco’s PBS (Mediatech) once cultures reached an OD600 of +1.0. To stimulate the Salmonella virulence program, cells were transferred to a low pH, low magnesium, and low iron (LPM) medium comprised of 8 µM MgCL2, 0.5 µM ferric citrate, 5 mM KCl, 7.5 mM NH4SO4, 0.5 mM K2SO4, 0.3% glycerol v/v, 0.00001% thiamine, 337 µM H3PO4, and 80 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid at pH 5.8. Briefly, cell pellets from the 7 mL LB media were suspended in LPM media and centrifuged. The supernatant was discarded and cell pellets were suspended in 2 mL of LPM media and used to inoculate 700 mL of LPM in a 2.8 L flask. Cells were harvested after 4 h or 20 h, then washed and isolated as above. Three biological replicates were performed for each of the conditions described above.","MTBLS35"

The cells were lysed by bead-beating, and the lysates were transferred into new tubes. Subsequently, 100 µL aliquots of cell lysates were extracted with four volumes of chilled (-20°C) chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and the aqueous phases after centrifugation were transferred to glass vials and dried in vacuo (SpeedVac; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). All samples were kept at -80°C prior to chemical derivatization for GC-MS analysis.","MTBLS35"
"Chromatography","Chromatography was carried out on an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph using the manufacturer's software (Chemstation) and a HP-5MS gas chromatography column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA; 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film thickness).","MTBLS35"

One microliter of each sample was injected in splitless mode and with the port temperature held at 250°C throughout analysis. The GC oven was initially maintained at 60°C for 1 min and then ramped to 325°C by 10°C/min and kept at this final temperature for 5 min to complete an analysis cycle.

Retention indices (RI) were calculated based on the analysis of a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters (C8 - C30) (Agilent Technologies) as external retention time standards, then their retention index information was subsequently applied to all experimental chromatograms for retention time alignment. MetaboliteDetector parameters for peak detection and deconvolution are as follows: Peak threshold, 7; minimum peak height, 7; deconvolution width, 8.","MTBLS35"
"Metabolite identification","Deconvoluted features were identified by matching to the Agilent Fiehn Metabolomics Retention Time Locked Library, which contains mass spectral and retention index information for approximately 700 metabolites. Each initial match to the library was manually inspected to confirm a confident identification. MetaboliteDetector software was used for database matching and batch identification/quantification parameters are as follows: required score, 0.6; ΔRI, 25; minimum S/N, 20; maximum peak discrepancy index, 100. Ions 73 and 143 were excluded from use as metabolite quantification ions, since these are due to fragmentation of the trimethylsilyl groups. Otherwise, three unique fragment ions were assigned to each metabolite for quantification and used for each individual GC-MS analysis when processing the data in batch mode. The summed areas of the three quantification ions were exported from MetaboliteDetector and used in further statistical anayses. All identifications were manually validated by inspection of retention index and spectrum matches.","MTBLS35"
"Chemical derivatization","Dried metabolite extracts were briefly dried again to remove any residual water prior to chemical derivatization. To protect carbonyl groups and reduce the number of tautomeric isomers, 20 µL of methoxyamine in pyridine (30 mg/mL) were added to each sample, followed by incubation at 37°C with generous shaking for 90 min. To derivatize hydroxyl and amine groups to trimethylsilyated (TMS) forms, 80 µL of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) with 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) were added to each vial, followed by incubation at 37°C with shaking for 30 min. The samples were allowed to cool to room temperature and were then analyzed by GC-MS in random order. For technical replicates, each of the derivatized samples was split into two different vials and analyzed separately.","MTBLS35"

Flowers were sampled in five to ten day intervals up to anthesis (10, 15, 20, 30, 40) and daily post-anthesis (47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54). Breaker fruit were defined as those showing the first signs of ripening-associated colour change from green to orange.

After changing the medium (triplicate washes with sulfur-depleted Tris acetate phosphate medium followed by centrifugation at 2,500 x g, 4 min, 20 °C), the cultures were adjusted to ~1.2 x 107 cells per ml (~27 µg of chlorophyll/ml) and supplemented with 1 mM glucose for optimal H2 production in Stm6Glc4. The gas-tight bioreactors were then illuminated with continuous light (300µmol x m^-2 x s^-1) for up to 120 h. H2 Measurement—H2 production was determined volumetrically, and the gas quality was measured via gas chromatography as described in a previous study. Chlorophyll Fluorescence Measurements—Chlorophyll a fluorescence yields were determined at room temperature (Mini- PAM, Walz, Germany). Photosynthetic quantum yield (Phi PSII) was determined by illuminating cell suspensions with actinic white light (300 µmol x m^-2 x s^-1, saturation pulse of 15,000 µmol x m^-2 x s^-1). Fluorescence parameters were recorded, and quantum yield was calculated (Phi PSII = (F'_m - F_t)/F'_m) and recorded every 2 h.","MTBLS37"

"Data transformation","Nonprocessed MS data from GC-TOF/MS analysis were exported in NetCDF format to MATLAB 6.5 (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA), where all data-pretreatment procedures, such as smoothing, alignment, time-window setting, and H-MCR (Jonsson et al., 2004;2005), were carried out.","MTBLS47"
"Metabolite identification","The resolved MS spectra were matched against reference mass spectra using the NIST mass spectral search program for the NIST/EPA/NIH mass spectral library (version 2.0) and our custom software for peak annotation written in JAVA. Peaks were identified or annotated based on retention indices (RIs) and the reference mass spectra comparison to the Golm Metabolome Database (GMD) and our in-house spectral library.The amount of S-adenosyl-methionine was calculated by the sum of the mass numbers at m/z 188 and 236 using Leco ChromaTOF software version 2.32 (LECO, St. Joseph, MI, USA) since this compound was not adequately detected by H-MCR.","MTBLS47"
"Derivatization","For methoximation, 20 μl of methoxyamine hydrochloride (20 mg/ml in pyridine) was added to the sample. After 30 h of derivatization at room temperature, the sample was trimethylsilylated for 1 h using 20 μl of MSTFA with 1% TMCS at 37°C with shaking. Twenty μl of n-heptane was added following silylation. All the derivatization steps were performed in the vacuum glove box VSC-100 (Sanplatec, Japan) filled with 99.9995% (G3 grade) of dry nitrogen.","MTBLS47"
"Sample collection","Bloodstream-form Trypanosoma brucei brucei (s427) were cultured in vitro in either HMI11 (Gibco), CMM or modified media with 10% FCS Gold (PAA). Cell culture grade (or high purity) D-glucose, L-cysteine, L-glutamine and all other medium components were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 5 ml cultures were maintained in 25 ml vented flasks (Corning) at 37 ºC with 5% CO2. Cultures were grown to a maximum density of 4 × 106 cells/ml and sub-cultured by 1 in 100 or 1 in 1000 dilution, every 2 or 3 days, respectively. Cell counts were obtained by haemocytometer (Neubauer).","MTBLS49"
"Extraction","Metabolite extraction was performed according to previously described methods. 25 ml of cell culture was quenched by rapid cooling to 4 ºC in a dry ice/ethanol bath. Cell pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 1250 x g for 10 minutes, and 5 µl spent media was removed and extracted by addition of 100 µl chloroform/methanol/water (1:3:1). The remaining cell pellet was washed with 1 ml PBS, and the washed pellet (5 × 107 cells) was extracted with 100 µl chloroform/methanol/water (1:3:1) by mixing for 1 h at 4 ºC, before centrifugation to remove precipitate. The resulting metabolite solution was stored at -80 ºC until analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Comparative data from HMI11 and CMM cell pellets and spent media are from 5 independent biological replicates.","MTBLS49"
"Chromatography","The LC separation was performed using hydrophilic interaction chromatography with a ZIC-HILIC 150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm column (Merck Sequant), operated by a Dionex UltiMate liquid chromatography system (Dionex, Camberley, Surrey), and coupled to a FAMOS autosampler. The LC mobile phase was a linear gradient from 80% B to 20% B over 30 min, followed by an 8 min wash with 5% B, and 8 min re-equilibration with 80% B, where solvent B is 0.08% formic acid in acetonitrile and solvent A is 0.1% formic acid in water. The flow rate was 300 µl/min, column temperature 20 °C, injection volume 10 µl, and samples were maintained at 4 °C.","MTBLS49"
"Mass spectrometry","The mass spectrometry was performed using an Orbitrap Exactive (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, U.K.) with a HESI 2 probe. The spectrometer was operated in polarity switching mode, with the following settings: resolution 50,000, AGC 1 × 106, m/z range 70–1400, sheath gas 40, auxiliary gas 20, sweep gas 1, probe temperature 275 °C, and capillary temperature 250 °C. For positive mode ionization: source voltage +4 kV, capillary voltage +50 V, tube voltage +70 V, skimmer voltage +20 V. For negative mode ionization: source voltage -3.5 kV, capillary voltage -50 V, tube voltage -70 V, skimmer voltage -20 V. Mass calibration was performed for each polarity immediately before each analysis batch, within 48 h for all samples. The calibration mass range was extended to cover small metabolites by inclusion of low-mass contaminants with the standard Thermo calmix masses (below m/z 1400), acetonitrile dimer for positive ion electrospray ionization (PIESI) mode (m/z 83.0604) and C3H5O3 for negative ion electrospray ionization (NIESI) mode (m/z 89.0244). To enhance calibration stability, lock-mass correction was also applied to each analytical run using these ubiquitous low-mass contaminants.","MTBLS49"

"Metabolite identification","Metabolite identification is based on accurate mass and predicted retention time, which is accepted as a level 3 standard of identification by the Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI), but should be considered as a putative identification. Retention time was verified by authentic standards for the major HMI11 components and other metabolites where possible.","MTBLS49"
"Sample collection","The Glc-tolerant strain of Synechocystis served as the wild type and was obtained from Prof. Murata (National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan). The generation and characterization of the mutants ΔglcD, bearing a defect in the GlcD coding gene sll0404, and ΔgcvT, bearing a defect in gene sll0171 coding for the T-protein subunit of the Gly decarboxylase complex, have been described elsewhere [1][2]. For all experiments, axenic cultures of the cyanobacteria were grown photoautotrophically in batch cultures using 3 cm glass vessels with 5 mm glass tubes for aeration (bubbling flow rate was 5 ml/min) and 29 °C growth temperature under continuous illumination of 130 µmol photons s-1 m-2 (warm light, Osram L58 W32/3). For shift experiments, cells were precultivated with air enriched by 5% CO2 (HC) in BG11 medium [3], pH 7.0. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in fresh BG11 at an optical density at 750 nm (OD750) of 0.8. After 1 h cultivation under HC conditions, Ci limitation was set by transferring those exponentially growing cultures to bubbling with ambient air containing 0.035% CO2 (LC). To prove PII protein phosphorylation, cells were shifted to HC and LC conditions in BG11 medium without combined N (replacing NaNO3 by equimolar amounts of NaCl) and nitrate-containing standard BG11, respectively. Growth was monitored by measurements of the OD750. Cultivation of mutants was performed at 50 µg/ml kanamycin or 20 µg/ml spectinomycin. Contamination by heterotrophic bacteria was checked by spreading 0.2 ml of culture on Luria-Bertani plates. All experiments were repeated using at least three independent cell cultures. ,"MTBLS5"

"Sample collection","Seeds of Lotus japonicus var. Gifu were germinated on agar plates containing agarified half-strength BD solution [1] plus 2 mm KNO3 and 2 mm NH4NO3. Four days after imbibition, seedlings were transplanted to soil (Einheit, type null) in 10 cm pots, and irrigated with the above solution. Two salt-stress treatments were implemented: (i) gradual step acclimation to various final NaCl concentrations, or (ii) initial acclimation growth at various NaCl concentrations. The gradual acclimation started 8 days post-imbibition, and the salt concentration was increased in three steps of 4 days from 0 to 50, 100 and 150 mm NaCl. A subset of plants was kept at each salt level. Initial acclimation growth exposed plants from germination onwards to nutrient solution supplemented with 25, 50 and 75 mm NaCl. In both cases, fresh nutrient solution was prepared every 4 days. The total duration of greenhouse culture was 28 days under a 16/8 h day/night regime, 23 ± 2°C, 55–65% relative humidity. Whole shoots, excluding cotyledons, were sampled in situ into liquid nitrogen in the middle of the light period. Three successive independent experiments (experiments 1, 2 and 3) were performed during the spring season. Each experiment consisted of seven sample sets: control (no salts), 50, 100, 150 (gradual step acclimatization), ia25, ia50 and ia75 (initial acclimatization). Each set had seven independent biological replicate pools of four plants, with the exception of ia75 treatment in experiments 2 and 3 where fewer replicates were available (five and four, respectively). The stress doses used in the experimental designs were not lethal within the cultivation period, and at harvest all plants were in the vegetative stage, and roots did not show nodules. Growth was estimated by determination of mean fresh weight of the pooled shoots, and soil electrical conductivity was determined on 1:2 dried soil:water extraction.,"MTBLS54"

"Chromatography","A Waters Acquity UPLC coupled via an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface to a Synapt HDMS QTOF MS (Waters, Manchester, UK) operating in W-mode and controlled by MassLynx 4.1 was used. The UPLC conditions were developed based in an in house previous published method (Arapitsas, Scholz, et al., 2012) and small changes were made in order to have a shorter chromatographic run and smaller back pressures. All samples were analysed on a reversed phase (RP) ACQUITY UPLC 1.8 µm 2.1 x 150 mm HSS T3 column (Waters) protected with an Acquity UPLC® BEH HSS T3 1.7 µm, 2.1 x 5 mm precolumn (Waters), at 40 °C and under a mobile phase flow rate of 0.28 ml/min. Water was used as weak eluting solvent (A) and methanol as strong elution solvent (B); formic acid 0.1% v/v was used as additive in both eluents. The multistep linear gradient used was as follows: 0-1 min, 100% A isocratic; 1-3 min, 100-90 % A linear; 3-18 min, 90-60 % A linear; 18-21 min, 60-0 % A linear; 21-25.5 min, 0 % A isocratic; 25.5-25.6 min, 0-100 % A linear; 25.6-28 min 100% isocratic. Injection volume was 10 µl, unless otherwise stated, and the samples were kept at 4 ºC throughout the analysis.","MTBLS55"
"Mass spectrometry","A Waters Acquity UPLC coupled via an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface to a Synapt HDMS QTOF MS (Waters, Manchester, UK) operating in W-mode and controlled by MassLynx 4.1 was used. Mass spectrometric data were collected by different runs in positive and negative ESI mode over a mass range of 50 to 2000 amu with scan duration of 0.3 s in centroid mode. The transfer collision energy and trap collision energy were set at 6 V and 4 V. The source parameters were set as follows: capillary 3 kV for positive scan and 2.5 kV for negative scan, sampling cone 25 V, extraction cone 3V, source temperature 150 ºC, desolvation temperature 500 ºC, desolvation gas flow 1000 l/h and nebulizer gas 50 l/h. External calibration of the instrument was performed at the beginning of each batch of analysis by direct infusion of a sodium formate solution (10% formic acid/0.1 M NaOH/Acetonitrile at a ratio of 1/1/8) by controlling the mass accuracy from 40 to 2000 m/z (less than 5 ppm) and mass resolution (over 14000 FWHM). LockMass calibration was applied using a solution of leucine enkephaline (0.5 mg/l, m/z 556.2771 for positive and 554.2620 for negative ion mode) at 0.1 ml/min.","MTBLS55"
"Data transformation","For the quality control of the analysis and the number of features determination the raw data was converted to CDF (Waters Databridge) format and then processed using XCMS for feature extraction, grouping and alignment. For peak picking, the matched Filter algorithm was used with a peak width estimate of 20 s. The signal to noise parameter was set to S/N = 4. Data extraction parameters were selected on the basis of the characteristics of chromatographic and mass spectrometric performance. The Peak Table output of XCMS was used for the statistical analysis by the software EZInfo SIMCA-P version 12.0.0 (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) under Pareto normalization. The PCA plots of EZInfo SIMCA-P were used for the quality control of the data sets by checking the distribution of the QC injections. Orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to find features/tentative markers contributing to groups/conditions discriminations, based on the t-test with Mann-Whitney U-test and the S-plot of the SIMCA-P software.","MTBLS55"
"Metabolite identification","Peak annotation was performed manually by comparing retention times and mass spectra (mass difference less than 10 ppm and two ions) to those of the standard, when available. Tentative identification of the chromatographic peaks, without a standard, was made by using spectral features (mass difference less than 10 ppm of theoretical value at least one indicative fragment and the isotopic pattern), and literature information about chromatographic properties and mass spectra records from external database like HMDB, Kegg and MassBank and an internal database for the wine metabolome based in bibliography.","MTBLS55"
"Sample collection","The UPLC-QTOF MS untargeted analyses were preformed within two months after the end of the experimental design and during this period wines were maintained at 4 °C so to block or slow down all possible reactions. Wines were uncorked under nitrogen atmosphere and an aliquot was transferred in a 15 ml amber vial (filled to its capacity). Then, always under nitrogen atmosphere, 3 quality control (QC) pool samples were prepared: (i) one pool sample by using 0.5 ml of each wine (QC), (ii) one pool sample by using 0.5 ml of each House conservation final point (24 months) wine (QCH) and, (iii) one pool sample by using 0.5 ml of each Cellar conservation final point (24 months) wine (QCC). For the dilution test, the QC sample was diluted 1:1 and 1:2 with Milli-Q water. Following the dilution experiment results, 1 ml of each wine was diluted with 1 ml Milli-Q water (1:1 dilution) and then 20 µl of the internal standard mix was added. Finally every sample/QC was filtrated with 0.2 µm PTFE filters into a 2 ml autosampler amber vial (MS certificated) prior the LC/MS analysis. The internal standard mix was 10 mg 3-indol proprionic acid and 17 mg 2,6-dihydroxy benzoic acid in 10 ml of MeOH:OH (1:1). For the blank the same procedure was followed but instead of wine 1 ml of Milli-Q water was used. The standard mix (STDMIX) was a mixture of trans-piceid (20 ppm), caffeic acid (50 ppm), catechin (5 ppm), malvidin 3-glucoside (5 ppm), quercetin 3-rutinoside (6 ppm), adenosine 2-monophosphate (45 ppm), malic acid (48 ppm), nicotinic acid (46 ppm), phenylalanine (42 ppm), and glucose (45 ppm) in MeOH:H2O (70:30).,"MTBLS55"

"Extraction","Briefly, the plasma samples were thawed on ice and vortexed. For metabolite extraction, 25 µl of plasma sample was mixed with 175 µl of extraction buffer (25% acetonitrile in 40% methanol and 35% water) containing internal standards (debrisoquine, 4-nitrobenzoic acid, ceramide and lysophosphatidic acid). The samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 14,000 r.p.m. at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and dried under vacuum. The dried samples were reconstituted in 200 µl of buffer containing 5% methanol, 1% acetonitrile and 94% water. The samples were centrifuged at 13,000 r.p.m. for 20 min at 4 °C to remove fine particulates. The supernatant was transferred to a glass vial for MS analysis.","MTBLS72"
"Chromatography","Each sample (2 µl) was injected onto a reverse-phase CSH C18 1.7 µM, 2.1 mm x 100 mm column using an Acquity H-class UPLC system (Waters Corporation, USA). The gradient mobile phase comprised of water containing 0.1% formic acid solution (Solvent A), 100% acetonitrile (Solvent B) and 10% acetonitrile in isopropanol containing 0.1% formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate (Solvent C). Each sample was resolved for 13 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min for 8 min and then 0.4 ml/min from 8 to 13 min. The UPLC gradient consisted of 98% A and 2% B for 0.5 min and then a ramp of curve 6 to 60% B and 40% A from 0.5 min to 4.0 min, followed by a ramp of curve 6 to 98% B and 2% A from 4.0 to 8.0 min, a ramp to 5% B and 95% C from 9.0 min to 10.0 min at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min and finally a ramp to 98% A and 2% B from 11.0 min to 13 min. The column eluent was introduced directly into the mass spectrometer by electrospray ionization.","MTBLS72"
"Mass spectrometry","Mass spectrometry was performed on a quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) instrument (Xevo G2 QTOF, Waters Corporation, USA) operating in either negative (ESI-) or positive (ESI+) electrospray ionization mode with a capillary voltage of 3,200 V in positive mode and 2,800 V in negative mode and a sampling cone voltage of 30 V in both modes. The desolvation gas flow was set to 750 l/h, and the temperature was set to 350 °C. The source temperature was set at 120 °C. Accurate mass was maintained by introduction of a lock-spray interface of leucine-enkephalin (556.2771 [M+H]+ or 554.2615 [M-H]-) at a concentration of 2 pg/µl in 50% aqueous acetonitrile. Data were acquired in centroid MS mode from 50 to 1,200 m/z mass range for TOF-MS scanning as single injection per sample, and the batch acquisition was repeated to check experimental reproducibility.","MTBLS72"
"Data transformation","Lipidomics: The data were preprocess using XCMS (Scripps Institute). The m/z features of metabolites were normalized with log transformation that stabilized the variance, followed by a quantile normalization to make the empirical distribution of intensities the same across samples. The metabolites were selected among all those known to be identifiable using a ROC regularized learning technique based on the LASSO penalty as implemented with the R package 'glmnet', which uses cyclical coordinate descent in a path-wise fashion. We first obtained the regularization path over a grid of values for the tuning parameter, λ, through tenfold cross-validation. The optimal value of the tuning parameter lambda, which was obtained by the cross-validation procedure, was then used to fit the model. All the features with nonzero coefficients were retained for subsequent analysis. This technique is known to reduce overfitting and achieve similar prediction accuracy as the sparse supporting vector machine. The classification performance of the selected metabolites was assessed using area under the ROC curve (AUC). The ROC can be understood as a plot of the probability of classifying correctly the positive samples against the rate of incorrectly classifying true negative samples. So the AUC measure of an ROC plot is a measure of predictive accuracy. To maintain rigor of independent validation, the simple logistic model with the ten-metabolite panel was used, although a more refined model can yield greater AUC.","MTBLS72"

"multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry","In this study, targeted metabolomic analysis of plasma samples was performed using the Biocrates Absolute-IDQ P180 (BIOCRATES, Life Science AG, Innsbruck, Austria). This validated targeted assay allows for simultaneous detection and quantification of metabolites in plasma samples (10 µl) in a high-throughput manner. The plasma samples were processed as per the instructions by the manufacturer and analyzed on a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Xevo TQ-S, Waters Corporation, USA) operating in the MRM mode. The measurements were made in a 96-well format for a total of 148 samples, and seven calibration standards and three quality control samples were integrated in the kit. Briefly, the flow injection analysis tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) method was used to quantify a panel of 144 lipids simultaneously by multiple reaction monitoring. The other metabolites are resolved on the UPLC and quantified using scheduled MRMs. The kit facilitates quantitation of 21 amino acids, hexose, carnitine, 39 acylcarnitines, 15 sphingomyelins, 90 phosphatidylcholines and 19 biogenic amines. Data analysis was performed using the MetIQ software (Biocrates), and the statistical analyses included the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with follow-up Mann-Whitney U-tests for pairwise comparisons using the STAT pack module v3 (Biocrates).

Plates were incubated at room temperature (~23 ˚C) under a fluorescent grow light (General Electric PL/AQ, Fairfield, CT) with a continuous photon flux of 20 µE/m^2/s. No exogenous sources of organic carbon were added. Two morphologically distinct cyanobacteria that grew on the plate were resuspended in HLA broth and physically isolated with a micropipette under a dissecting microscope. Each filament, including its co-isolated heterotrophs, was inoculated into sterile HLA broth and cultivated, yielding two unicyanobacterial consortia, UCC-A and UCC-O. The consortia were there after maintained continuously, with passaging performed every 4 weeks at a dilution of 1:100 into 100 mL of HLA broth in 250 mL borosilicate-glass Erlenmeyer flasks under the cultivation conditions described above.,"MTBLS75"

"Extraction","Low molecular weight metabolites were extracted from each cardiac tissue using a methanol / chloroform / water solvent system (final solvent ratio 2:2:1.8) as described previously [1]. Briefly, pre-weighed frozen tissue was homogenised in 8 ml/g of ice-cold methanol and 2.5 ml/g of ice-cold water in Precellys homogenisation tubes containing ceramic beads. The homogenate was transferred to 1.8 ml glass vials to which 8 ml/g chloroform and 4 ml/g water were added. Samples were vortexed and placed on ice for 10 mins before the biphasic mixture was centrifuged at 1800 g for 10 mins. After 5 mins at room temperature, ten 15 µl aliquots of the polar layer were transferred into ten 1.8 ml glass vials, dried in a centrifugal evaporator (Thermo Savant, Holbrook, NY) and stored at -80 °C until analysis. Further tissue from the same anatomical region of the same twenty hearts was extracted as one pool and then aliquoted in 100 µl aliquots to make ten identical QC samples.,"MTBLS79"

"Sample collection","The diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain FY1679 were grown in fermenters, essentially as described before [1]. A set of chemostat cultures under C-, N-, P- and S-limiting conditions were established at a series of dilution rates (0.07, 0.10, 0.20 /h). Cultures were fed with a defined mineral medium limiting growth by carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, or sulphur, all other nutritional requirements were in excess at a constant residual concentration. Glucose and vitamins were added to the medium after separate sterilization. Glucose was heat-sterilized at 120 °C. Vitamins were prepared and sterilized by filtration through 0.2 µm filters (Sartopore®2, Sartorius, UK). Chemostat cultivation was performed in 2-litre fermenters (FT Applikon Ltd., UK) with a working volume of 1.0 l, a temperature of 30 °C and a stirrer speed of 750 rpm. The culture pH was maintained at 5.0 by automatic addition of 2 M NaOH or HCl as required, via an Applikon ADI-1030 biocontroller. Aerobic cultivation was performed by maintaining an air flow of 1.0 l/min. The dissolved oxygen concentration in all chemostat cultures, as measured with an Ingold polarographic oxygen electrode, was above 50% of saturation. To avoid loss of volatile metabolites, the off-gas condenser was cooled to 4 °C, connected to a cryostat. Off-gas oxygen and carbon dioxide levels were monitored with a Tandem gas analyser (Magellan Instruments, UK). Steady state conditions were deemed established once biomass levels (absorbance and dry weight measurements), dissolved oxygen, and off-gas fractions remained constant over three residence times (three volume changes). For the rapamycin study, a batch culture growing at mid-exponential phase in minimal medium was established under the same cultivation conditions as for chemostat experiments. This was divided into two flasks. Rapamycin (200 ng/ml) was added to one half, and the vehicle added to the other, as the control. Samples were taken at 0, 1, 2 and 4 hrs after the treatment.,"MTBLS8"

"Analysis","Multivariate curve resolution (MCR) was performed using nonnegativity constraints in both the chromatographic and spectral dimensions. No unimodality or selectivity constraints were imposed. The MCR algorithm was started using initial guesses from orthogonal projection approach (OPA), using eight components for each individual time window. The number of eight components was chosen to be sufficient to cover all expected compounds plus a few unexpected ones. OPA was initialized with the spectra of those standards known to be eluting in the corresponding time windows, and the rest of the eight components were found by the OPA algorithm. Again, to ensure complete automation, no attempt was made at this stage to optimize the number of components. The MCR algorithm was allowed to run for at most 1,000 iterations. If the default convergence criterion was met, the run was terminated earlier. MCR models were then stored for visualization and further inspection. ,"MTBLS85"

A labeled lipid standard mixture containing PC(16:1-D3/0:0), PC(16:1/16:1-D6) and TG(16:0/16:0/16:0–13C3) at a concentration level of 0.1 µg per sample was added into the separated lipid extracts (100 µl) before UPLC-MS analysis.","MTBLS92"
"Chromatography","Lipid extracts were analyzed on a Waters Q-Tof Premier mass spectrometer combined with an Acquity Ultra Performance LCTM (UPLC™). The column (at 50°C) was an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 2.1 mm × 100 mm with 1.7-μm particles. The solvent system was (A) ultrapure water (1% 1 M NH4Ac and 0.1% HCOOH) and (B) LC/MS-grade acetonitrile/isopropanol (1:1, 1% 1M NH4Ac and 0.1% HCOOH) and the gradient started from 65% A/35% B, reached 80% B in 2 min, 100% B in 7 min and remained there for 7 min. The flow rate was 0.400 ml/min and 2 µl aliquot was injected (Acquity Sample Organizer, at 10°C).","MTBLS92"

"Sample collection"," A final inoculum of 1.6x10^8 CFU S. Typhimurium/mouse was delivered by oral gavage to 10 mice (two cages of five mice each = Salmonella-infected). An equal number of mock-infected animals (two cages of five mice each = control) were administered an equal volume of sterile saline. Our infecting dose (10^8 CFU/mouse) aimed to establish a persistent infection that would ensure observation of S. Typhimurium proteins in downstream analyses. On the day prior to infection, and at seven time points post-infection, mice from one cage were transferred to a clean cage and fecal samples produced at that time were collected, pooled, and immediately frozen at 280˚ C. Samples were collected on days -1, 1, 3, 6, 10, 14, 21, and 28. Frozen fecal samples were thawed on ice, and starting material weight was measured. Samples ranged from four to 25 fecal pellets per pooled sample. After thawing, 150 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer was added to the sample (between 1-2.5 ml based upon starting weight; volumes were recorded and used for downstream normalization), which was subsequently vortexed to disrupt fecal pellets. The resulting slurry was filtered through a 70 mm sieve to separate and remove large debris (mostly undigested food particles). Filtrate was centrifuged (900xg for 10 min), and the protein-rich pellet thought to contain cellular material was retained as "P1." The supernatant was centrifuged to further clarify the sample (15,000xg for 10 min). The pellet was retained as "P2" and the supernatant retained as "SN2." Preliminary analyses demonstrated that P2 samples contained prohibitively small protein yields; therefore, P2 samples were not investigated further. Proteomic and 16s rDNA sequencing analyses were performed using P1, and metabolite and glycan analyses were performed using SN2. ","MTBLS96"
"Extraction","All chemicals and reagents used in metabolomics analyses were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), except for ammonium bicarbonate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), mixture of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and deuterated myristic acid (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Deionized and purified water was used to prepare buffer and standard solutions (Nanopure Infinity ultrapure water system, Barnstead, Newton, WA). SN2 samples (see Fecal sample preparation) were transferred to 0.6 ml microcentrifuge tubes, and water soluble metabolites were extracted with four volumes of chilled (-20˚ C) chloroform: methanol mixture (2:1). After separating the two phases via centrifugation (12,000xg, 5 min), the upper aqueous layers were transferred to glass vials and dried under a vacuum concentrator (SpeedVac; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). All extracted metabolites were subjected to chemical derivatization to enhance their stability and volatility during GC-MS analysis. Methoxyamine in pyridine (30 mg/ml) was added to each dried sample, and incubated at 37˚C with shaking for 90 min to protect carbonyl groups and reduce the number of tautomeric peaks. N-methyl-N- (trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) with 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) was then added, followed by incubation at 37˚C with shaking for 30 min to transform hydroxyl and amine groups to trimethylsilyated (TMS) forms. The samples were then allowed to cool to room temperature and were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC)-MS.","MTBLS96"
"Chromatography","The GC-MS system used in this study consisted of an Agilent GC 7890A coupled with a single quadrupole MSD 5975C (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). GC separations were performed on a HP-5MS column (30m x 0.25mm x 0.25 µm; Agilent Technologies). The injection mode was splitless and 1 ml of each sample was injected; the injection port temperature was held at 250˚ C throughout the analysis. The GC oven was initially maintained at 60˚ C for 1 min and then ramped to 325˚ C by 10˚ C/min, followed by a 5 min hold at 325˚ C. ","MTBLS96"
"Mass spectrometry","An Agilent GC 7890A coupled with a single quadrupole MSD 5975C (Agilent Technologies, Inc.; Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used, and the samples were blocked and analyzed in random order for each experiment. Data were collected over the mass range 50-550 m/z. A mixture of FAMEs (C8-C28) was analyzed once per day together with the samples for retention index alignment purposes during subsequent data analysis.","MTBLS96"
"Data transformation","GC-MS raw data files from each Experiment were processed using the Metabolite Detector software, version 2.0.6 beta. Briefly, Agilent.D files were converted to netCDF format using Agilent Chemstation, followed by conversion to binary files using Metabolite Detector. Retention indices of detected metabolites were calculated based on the analysis of the FAMEs mixture, followed by their chromatographic alignment across all analyses after deconvolution.","MTBLS96"
"Metabolite identification","Metabolites were initially identified by matching experimental spectra to an augmented version of FiehnLib (i.e., the Agilent Fiehn Metabolomics Retention Time Locked (RTL) Library, containing spectra and validated retention indices for over 700 metabolites), using a Metabolite Detector match probability threshold of 0.6 (combined retention index and spectral probability). All metabolite identifications were manually validated to reduce deconvolution errors during automated data-processing and to eliminate false identifications. The NIST 08 GC-MS library was also used to cross validate the spectral matching scores obtained using the Agilent library and to provide identifications of unmatched metabolites. Fragment ions due to trimethylsilylation (i.e. m/z 73 and 147) were excluded from the determination of metabolite abundance. A matrix of identified metabolites, unidentified metabolite features (characterized by mass spectra and retention indices and assigned as "unknown"), and their abundances was created for each Experiment for statistical analysis. Features resulting from GC column bleeding were removed from the data matrices prior to further data processing and analysis.","MTBLS96"
"Sample collection","All samples included in the study were collected from the  apple germoplasm collection of the Fondazione Edmund Mach (FEM) (Trento, Italy).,"MTBLS99"
